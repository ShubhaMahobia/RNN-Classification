# RNN - IMDB Dataset Review Classification

This project involves building a sentiment analysis model using Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) to classify movie reviews from the IMDb dataset as either positive or negative. The IMDb dataset consists of 50,000 highly polarized movie reviews, with 25,000 labeled as positive and 25,000 as negative, making it an ideal dataset for binary sentiment classification tasks.


## Live Deployment 

This project is hosted on - https://rnn-classification-4qyd35scpyeq4u9xjycxmd.streamlit.app/
